# Machine Learning on Manifolds

This package aims to provide machine learning tools on [Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold) based on [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html) and [Manopt.jl](https://manoptjl.org), as well as a few functions from [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/).
The package is inspired by [PosDefManifoldML.jl](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifoldML.jl) doing Machine Learning on the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices.
