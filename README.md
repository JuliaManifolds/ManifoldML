The Package `ManifoldML.jl` provides methods to do Machine Learning methods on Riemannian
manifolds. It is based on [`ManifoldsBase`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html)
in order to work with all manifolds from [`Manifolds.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/index.html).

Related packages are
* [`Manopt.jl`](https://manoptjl.org) for general optimization on manifolds â€“ this might be employed for certain optimization tasks
* [`PosDefManifoldML.jl`](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifoldML.jl/dev/) for the specific case on symmetric positive definite matrices.
